Hash Tables (Dictionaries):

. Hash Tables are frequently used in order to optimize algorithms.
. They are extremely useful when it comes to performing operations that involve looking up items.
. They are used to store key, value pairs.
. Hash tables are deterministic- Meaning that it will always return the same value when the same input is provided
  - For this reason hash tables can be used for storing and retrieving objects.

1 - USES:
        . In spell checkers - looking up words
        . Dictionaries - To look up words
        . Compilers - they use hash tables to quickly look up the address of functions or
          variables

        . Code editors, etc...

        - Hash tables are used in any instance that requires looking up an item very fast

2 - RUNTIME COMPLEXITIES:
        . insert:  O(1)
        . lookup:  O(1)
        . delete:  O(1)

        NOTE: in some scenarios these operation may run in O(n) but in practical terms they usually run in O(1)
