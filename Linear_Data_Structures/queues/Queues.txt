Queues:

. Queues are Data structures similar to stacks, except that in Queues, the first item inserted,
  is the first item to get out -> this is what is called FIFO(First in, First Out)

. Queues in programing are similar to queues of people in the real world. People Join from the back, and leave
   from the front.

1- Uses:
    . Queues are used in situation where a resources must be shared amongst multiple consumers.
       -> Said consumers would line up and use the resource one by one.

    examples:
        . Printers -> print what's requested in the order that the request is submitted
        . Operating systems use queues to manage processes
        . Web servers use queues to manage incoming requests


2 - RUNTIME COMPLEXITIES:

        Operations:
            . enqueue:  O(1)
            . dequeue:  O(1)
            . peek:     O(1)
            . isEmpty:  O(1)
            . isFull:   O(1)

        Operations in queues are similar to operations in stacks. They all run in constant time O(1),
        because items are added or removed from the end.
