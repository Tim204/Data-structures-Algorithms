# Data Structures and Algorithms With Python
Data structures and Algorithms make the ***tech world go round!***

## Description

Data Structures and Algorithms with python is basically a way to pass time while implementing all the different data structures, from scratch, using Python.

The project will consist of the implementation of all Linear and Non-Linear data
structures, as well as a solving a few common interview questions related to the data structures in question.


## Dependencies
* Python 3.9
