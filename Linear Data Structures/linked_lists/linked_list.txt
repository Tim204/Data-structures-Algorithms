LINKED LISTS:

. Linked list are the Second most commonly used Data structures after arrays.

. Unlike arrays(in certain programing languages), linked lists can grow and shrink automatically without
  wasting memory

. They require more memory than arrays because each node should have at least one reference to the next and |
  previous nodes


RUNTIME COMPLEXITIES:

    1. Lookup:
        By Index:   O(n)
        By Value:   O(n)
        -> Both operations involve traversing the list

    2 . Insert:
         Beginning: O(1)
         End:       O(1)
         -> We simply need to change the links

         Middle:   O(n)
         -> Insert an item in the middle involves a lookup

    3. Delete:
        Beginning: O(1)
        Middle:    O(n) -> Involves a lookup
        End:       O(n) -> Singly Linked lists
                   O(1) -> Doubly linked lists
