. AVL TREES:


. AVL trees are a special type of tree that self-balance, everytime you add or remove nodes.
. They accomplish this by ensuring that the difference between the heigh on the left and
  right subtrees is never more than 1.
. If the difference happens to be greater than 1 the trees rebalance themselves usin "Rotations".
